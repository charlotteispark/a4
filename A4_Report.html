    <h2>Proposition: The number of abortions decreased in red states due to policies from Trump administration.</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="Rate-Decrease.png" style="width:100%" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The change in abortion rate in states that voted for Trump in 2016 between 2017 and 2020. States colored red are those in which the abortion rate decreased during this period, and those colored blue are those in which the abortion rate increased. The opacity of the color denotes the percent positive or negative change in the abortion rate. There are many red states demonstrating a strong downward trend in the number of abortion compared to those exhibiting an upwards trend.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The color scale was chosen so that the color indicating a decrease in abortion rate (red) is more vibrant than th color indicating an increase in abortion rate (blue). The color scale was not displayed prominently on the chart and was only mentioned in the caption. I would score this desicion a -1.5 in terms of earnestness. This decision helps make the visualization persuasive of the FOR viewpoint by drawing the reader's eye to the states with a decrease in abortion rate and drawing attention away from those with an increase. The color scale is also not what a reader might expect, leading them to jump to incorrect conclusions if they are not reading with a critical eye. The fact that states that voted for Clinton in 2016 are automatically grey plays also works well with this choice, as it helps the bright red (which argues for the proposition) stand out more in a sea of grey-adjacent colors. While I think this decision achieves its desired effect as a whole, I should note that there is enough blue still present in the chart to potenitally make the reader question the conclusion. </li>
				<li>The color of the Republican party was ued to represent a decrease in the number of abortions, an outcome that is generally considered positive regaredless of partisan affiliation. I would give this a -.5 on the earnestness scale. In making this decision, I am arguing that policies made during a Republican administration had a desired effect. By linking the outcomes directly to the policies, it makes the Republican party seem like the "good" guys. My hope is that this would make the reader more likely to sympathsize with the party, and thus more likely to accept the proposition which would line up with the party ideals. </li>
				<li>Only states that voted for Trump were displayed in the visualization. I would give this a -.5 on the earnestness scale. As I said in the title that I was focusing on states that supported Trump in 2016, I do not think that this is at all an unreasonable design decision. However, without giving the changes in rates for all states, it makes it hard for the reader to contextualize the result against national trends. Moreover, it makes it difficult for the reader to isolate the effect of the Trump administration on these rates, hopefully making them more likely to jump to the conclusion that the policies themselves are the reason for the rate changes and believe the proposition.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				<img src="Counties-Without-Clinics.png" style="width:100%" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
          The effects of Trump administration policy on abortion in Trump-supporting states. The upper portion juxtaposes the change in abortion rate in Republican states, as given in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president">NYT</a>, with the number of out of state abortions in 2020, showing that red states with lower in-state abortion rates during this period had signficantly more out of state abortions. The lower portion here shows the percent change in the number of women living in counties without available abortion clinics under Trump in red states. There are significantly more red states that saw a rise in the number of women without access to abortion compared to the number that saw little or no downward movement in this statistic.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Two maps of the United States were placed next to each other in the top half of this visual, one displaying the change in in-state abortion rate and one displaying the out-of-state rate in 2020. I would give this choice a +1.5 on the earnestness scale, as seeing both maps helps provide more context. I made this choice in order for the comparison between the two rates to be easy. I had hoped to highlight the fact that the same states with the largest increase in abortion rate also had the largest number of residents who traveled out of state for a service. I wanted this to call into question the proposition's assertion that the number of abortions decreased, insteading making the reader wonder if locations within the US simply changed. Another way I considered achieving this was by giving absolute numbers or aggregated numbers. Ultimately, however, I decided on the visual presented as the maps with relative percentages make a clean, digestible way for the readers to consume the data. </li>
				<li>Red, the color of the Republican party, was used to show the percentage of residents who traveled for abortion. I would give this a -.5 on the earnestness scale. My intention behind making this choice was to demonstrate that policies made during a Republican administration are the reason people had to travel. The intent of this is to bias the reader against the Republican party, whom the ideas in the FOR proposition support. This is a similar technique in the opposite direction to the second decision I made in the FOR visualization.</li>
				<li>In the botton half of the visualization, positive changes in the percent of women with no clinic in county were colored green and negative changes were red. I would give this a +.5 on the earnestness scale. The goal of this design choice would make was to make it easier for the reader to juxtapose the number of states with positive change compared to those with negative chance. I was already doing this by using the sort of bar chart displayed with the bars going in oppoisite directions, but I wanted to drive this point home even more for the reader. I think that this technique is gengerally effective, though the change in color scheme from red/blue to red/green may be confusing and not friendly for color-blind viewers. I ultimately chose to go through with the red/green as it removed partisan affiliation and focused more on the results themselves.</li>
				<li>Abortion providers (used in the 2014) and clinics (used in the 2020 data) were assumed to be the same and all reported as clinics in the bottom bar chart. I would give this a -1 on the earnestness scale. The goal in doing this was to streamline information for the reader, so they would spend less time focusing on the differences between exact termanlogies and more time focusing on the significant changes in the rates of women living in a county with no facility to get an abortion. Making such a choice was also a result of the non-standardized data provided. Overall, making this choice causes the reader to come away with the conclusion that, has become much harder to obtain an abortion during the Trump administration. In combination with the top graphic in this visual, I was aiming to explain away the decrease in rates by a difficulty in obtaning an abortion and a geographic relocation of where such services are occurring.</li>
				<li>In the caption, the source of the designation of each state as red or blue in the 2016 election is given. I would give this a +2 on the earnestness scale. This is aimed to help provide credibility to the audience, allwoing them to verify my analysis as the state designations are not available in the original dataset. I am hoping that this decision helps establish me as a trustworthy designer, making the readers more likely to believe my conclusion.</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>I personally found that it was hard to figure how to argue to directly oppose side of the same propositions using the same dataset. I found it easier to argue two positions which were different and ultimately implied opposing conclusions or argued for opposing viewpoints. Overall, I found it interesting that one of the biggest differences between the two visualizations I created was the amount of contextualization of the data I provided. In the visualization arguing for the proposition, I took a single column of the data more at face value whereas, in the visualization arguing against the proposition, I contextualized the data from the for visualization to explain that there were other factors at play that must be considered before jumping to conclusions. Additionally, I was not expecting to find myself using deceptive techniques in both my visualizations, reaffirming the idea we have discussed that one was not “objective” and the other “deceptive”.</p>

			<p>After having completed this assignment, I think of “ethical analysis and visualizations” as those designed with transparency and broader context in mind. Lining up with what we have discussed in reading groups, I am starting to think that ethical visualizations are ones that give the reader more information to possibly draw their own conclusions, as well as being transparent about their intents and limitations. Many of the visualizations that are deceptive in nature are those that take one aspect of the data and fixate on it without providing broader context, much as I have done in my first visualization. The main bounds I therefore draw to distinguish “acceptable” vs “misleading” choices are providing context and options for the reader to learn more if they choose. Doing this places control of the narrative more in the hands of the reader’s personal choices than the designer’s. However, I note that providing context can make visualizations less streamlined and palatable, perhaps causing readers to ignore them. The mall choices necessary to make a visualization interpretable – things as simple as color or axis scale -- impose the designer’s viewpoint. This causes me to question whether a fully “objective” visualization can exist that an audience would want to engage with.</p>
